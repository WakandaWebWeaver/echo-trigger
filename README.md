## Overview

EchoTrigger is a simple Python script to detect if a keyword has been spoken in a user's environment. It uses the [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/) library to listen to the user's microphone and detect the keyword. 
If the keyword is detected, the script will lower system volume to a specified level.
